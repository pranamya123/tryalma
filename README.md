## Overview

**TryAlma** is a Next.js web application designed to provide a seamless experience for managing leads. The app includes two main pages:
- **Lead Form** - A page for submitting lead information.
- **Leads Dashboard** - A page for viewing the submitted leads.

The application includes authentication functionality and requires users to log in before accessing the Leads Dashboard.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pranamya123/tryalma.git
   cd tryalma
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Run the following command to install all required dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

Once the project is set up, you can start the development server.

1. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the application on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

2. **Pages Available:**
   - **Lead Form**: [http://localhost:3000/lead-form](http://localhost:3000/lead-form) – A page where users can submit lead information.
   - **Leads Dashboard**: [http://localhost:3000/leads](http://localhost:3000/leads) – A page that displays all the submitted leads (requires authentication).

### Authentication

To access the Leads Dashboard page, you need to log in. Use the following credentials to log in as an admin user:

- **Email**: `admin@test.com`
- **Password**: `admin`

If you are not authenticated, you will be redirected to the login page.
